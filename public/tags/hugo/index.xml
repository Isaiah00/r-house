      <description>I thought it was worth posting about how I set up this blog as I had enormous trouble setting it up. Iâ€™d never done anything like this before and so some Google searching exposed me to many different technologies, but I had no clue what they did, which were best/easiest to work with and which combination I needed to use them in.
First off, big thanks go to John Muschelli and his YouTube video which got me up and running in no time.</description>
