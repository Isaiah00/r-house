      <description>Happy New Year!
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the time between Christmas and New Year being more productive than I would usually be, trying things out in R, some (relatively) successfully, others&amp;hellip;not so much.
I thought it would be worth writing about how embarking on Data Science isn&amp;rsquo;t all plain sailing, and can at times be incredibly frustrating! You often see people who make everything seem so effortless and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get such a skewed perception of how things are going to go.</description>

      <description>I thought it was worth posting about how I set up this blog as I had enormous trouble setting it up. Iâ€™d never done anything like this before and so some Google searching exposed me to many different technologies, but I had no clue what they did, which were best/easiest to work with and which combination I needed to use them in.
First off, big thanks go to John Muschelli and his YouTube video which got me up and running in no time.</description>
