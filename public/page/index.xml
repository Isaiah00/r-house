      <description>Hello, my name is Jamie Lendrum and welcome to my blog R-house!
I work as a Data Scientist for the UK Government and I&amp;rsquo;ve created this site to share my development and my personal projects using the R environment.
I graduated from the University of Portsmouth in 2001 with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics, and spent the first 15 years of my career working as an Operational Analyst. This basically involves using a spectrum of analytical techniques ranging from complex simulation modelling to expert judgement (often simultaneously) in order to answer complex questions, usually focussed on how and where money should be spent.</description>
