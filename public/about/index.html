      <p>Hello, my name is Jamie Lendrum and welcome to my blog <em>R-house</em>!</p>

<p>I work as a Data Scientist for the UK Government and I&rsquo;ve created this site to share my development and my personal projects using the R environment.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Portsmouth in 2001 with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics, and spent the first 15 years of my career working as an Operational Analyst. This basically involves using a spectrum of analytical techniques ranging from complex simulation modelling to expert judgement (often simultaneously) in order to answer complex questions, usually focussed on how and where money should be spent.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve built up a broad range of skills including problem structuring, project management, systems thinking, technical assurance, and consultancy, but my first love has always been getting my hands dirty tinkering with code tackling a meaty problem. My love of mathematics and coding combined with a love of learning has pushed me to now pursue a Data Science career and I am loving it so far!</p>

<p>I have developed this blog as an excuse to become better acquainted with R-Markdown and Git, but I also want a way of documenting my progression.</p>
