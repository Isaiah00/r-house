Hello, my name is Jamie Lendrum and welcome to my blog *R-house*!

I work as a Data Scientist for the UK Government and I've created this site to share my development and my personal projects using the R environment. 

I graduated from the University of Portsmouth in 2001 with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, and spent the first 15 years of my career working as an Operational Analyst. This basically involves using a spectrum of analytical techniques ranging from complex simulation modelling to expert judgement (often simultaneously) in order to answer complex questions, usually focussed on how and where money should be spent.

Over the years I've built up a broad range of skills including problem structuring, project management, systems thinking, technical assurance, and consultancy, but my first love has always been getting my hands dirty tinkering with code tackling a meaty problem. My love of mathematics and coding combined with a love of learning has pushed me to now pursue a Data Science career and I am loving it so far!

I have developed this blog as an excuse to become better acquainted with R-Markdown and Git, but I also want a way of documenting my progression.

More generally, my interests are:

* Seeing the world
* Star Wars
* Lego
* Star Wars Lego
* The music of Michael Jackson
* Science Fiction in general
